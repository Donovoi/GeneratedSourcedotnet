# GeneratedSourcedotnet
Just some source files Generated for use in older .NET programs.


Please feel free to use this. Not owned by me and you can do the same by following the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview) 

I have (hopefully) generated the source for the following DLL's:

```
HAL.*
NTDLL.*
KERNEL32.*
GDI32.*
USER32.*
COMCTL32.*
COMDLG32.*
WS2_32.*
ADVAPI32.*
NETAPI32.*
OLE32.*
SHSCRAP.*
WINMM.*
IMM32.*
ATL*.*
MFC*.*
MSVBVM60.*
VCOMP*.*
VCRUNTIME*.*
MSVCIRT.* 

```

Is there an easier way to generated this source? Let me know!
